# Asymmetric Box

The burrito box is based on libsodiumâ€™s public-key authenticated encryption, also known as a box. This implementation 
uses X25519 for key derivation, the XSalsa20 stream cipher, and Poly1305 for message authentication.

You should use the asymmetric box when you need to:
- Exchange messages between computers or between people
- Authenticate documents
- Avoid exposing secrets to the public
